@ARTICLE{Merton1973,
  title     = "Theory of Rational Option Pricing",
  author    = "Merton, Robert C",
  abstract  = "[The long history of the theory of option pricing began in 1900
               when the French mathematician Louis Bachelier deduced an option
               pricing formula based on the assumption that stock prices follow
               a Brownian motion with zero drift. Since that time, numerous
               researchers have contributed to the theory. The present paper
               begins by deducing a set of restrictions on option pricing
               formulas from the assumption that investors prefer more to less.
               These restrictions are necessary conditions for a formula to be
               consistent with a rational pricing theory. Attention is given to
               the problems created when dividends are paid on the underlying
               common stock and when the terms of the option contract can be
               changed explicitly by a change in exercise price or implicitly
               by a shift in the investment or capital structure policy of the
               firm. Since the deduced restrictions are not sufficient to
               uniquely determine an option pricing formula, additional
               assumptions are introduced to examine and extend the seminal
               Black-Scholes theory of option pricing. Explicit formulas for
               pricing both call and put options as well as for warrants and
               the new ``down-and-out'' option are derived. The effects of
               dividends and call provisions on the warrant price are examined.
               The possibilities for further extension of the theory to the
               pricing of corporate liabilities are discussed.]",

               possible to make sure profits by creating portfolios of long and
               short positions in options and their underlying stocks. Using
               this principle, a theoretical valuation formula for options is
               derived. Since almost all corporate liabilities can be viewed as
               combinations of options, the formula and the analysis that led
               to it are also applicable to corporate liabilities such as
               common stock, corporate bonds, and warrants. In particular, the
               formula can be used to derive the discount that should be
               applied to a corporate bond because of the possibility of
               default.",

  abstract  = "Machine learning is a field at the intersection of statistics
               and computer science that uses algorithms to extract information
               and knowledge from data. Its applications increasingly find
               their way into economics, political science, and sociology. We
               offer a brief introduction to this vast toolbox and illustrate
               its current uses in the social sciences, including distilling
               measures from new data sources, such as text and images;
               characterizing population heterogeneity; improving causal
               inference; and offering predictions to aid policy decisions and
               theory development. We argue that, in addition to serving
               similar purposes in sociology, machine learning tools can speak
               to long-standing questions on the limitations of the linear
               modeling framework, the criteria for evaluating empirical
               findings, transparency around the context of discovery, and the

               statistical methodology, both in scope and in influence. 'Big
               data', 'data science', and 'machine learning' have become
               familiar terms in the news, as statistical methods are brought
               to bear upon the enormous data sets of modern science and
               commerce. How did we get here? And where are we going? This book
               takes us on an exhilarating journey through the revolution in
               data analysis following the introduction of electronic
               computation in the 1950s. Beginning with classical inferential
               theories - Bayesian, frequentist, Fisherian - individual
               chapters take up a series of influential topics: survival
               analysis, logistic regression, empirical Bayes, the jackknife
               and bootstrap, random forests, neural networks, Markov chain
               Monte Carlo, inference after model selection, and dozens more.
               The distinctly modern approach integrates methodology and
               algorithms with statistical inference. The book ends with
               speculation on the future direction of statistics and data
