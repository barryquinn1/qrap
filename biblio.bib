@ARTICLE{Merton1973,
  title     = "Theory of Rational Option Pricing",
  author    = "Merton, Robert C",
  abstract  = "[The long history of the theory of option pricing began in 1900
               when the French mathematician Louis Bachelier deduced an option
               pricing formula based on the assumption that stock prices follow
               a Brownian motion with zero drift. Since that time, numerous
               researchers have contributed to the theory. The present paper
               begins by deducing a set of restrictions on option pricing
               formulas from the assumption that investors prefer more to less.
               These restrictions are necessary conditions for a formula to be
               consistent with a rational pricing theory. Attention is given to
               the problems created when dividends are paid on the underlying
               common stock and when the terms of the option contract can be
               changed explicitly by a change in exercise price or implicitly
               by a shift in the investment or capital structure policy of the
               firm. Since the deduced restrictions are not sufficient to
               uniquely determine an option pricing formula, additional
               assumptions are introduced to examine and extend the seminal
               Black-Scholes theory of option pricing. Explicit formulas for
               pricing both call and put options as well as for warrants and
               the new ``down-and-out'' option are derived. The effects of
               dividends and call provisions on the warrant price are examined.
               The possibilities for further extension of the theory to the
               pricing of corporate liabilities are discussed.]",

@ARTICLE{Black1973,

  abstract  = "If options are correctly priced in the market, it should not be
               possible to make sure profits by creating portfolios of long and
               short positions in options and their underlying stocks. Using
               this principle, a theoretical valuation formula for options is
               derived. Since almost all corporate liabilities can be viewed as
               combinations of options, the formula and the analysis that led
               to it are also applicable to corporate liabilities such as
               common stock, corporate bonds, and warrants. In particular, the
               formula can be used to derive the discount that should be
               applied to a corporate bond because of the possibility of
               default.",

              available to all students, instructors can change the way we
              teach statistical concepts. This article describes computational
